# Background #
Chronos, greek good of time, broke his our glass, that he used to make time pass.
To keep time flowing he needs a new machine to control time to replace the hour glass.

Likes the so called Agile approach (never understood how some one could do it another way)

# Enter the start time #
We Chronos the mighty demand to pass the current time to the magic machine to initialize our clock.

* As favour to us mortals the agrees to pass the milliseconds passed since 1970 01 01
* He wants the time to be print to the command line to check if the magic machine understood his command.
* Chronos lives on mount Olympus

# Display the time #
We Chronos the mighty demand to see the time pass on the magic rectangle so it may entertain us.

* Has to be a Swing application (he likes the music)
* Only display Hour and minutes
